From 1825 the name Volksgarten was in use.\n\nThe Volksgarten is laid out on the Hofburg side in the form of an English park with a sparse stock of trees in avenues. Between the entrance at the Burgtheater and the Grillparzer monument there is a rose garden with over 3000 rose bushes of more than 200 types of roses. In the center of the rose garden are rose beds framed by boxwood hedges, which contain most of the rose plants. Since 2001, the Volksgarten has also been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Center of Vienna.",

In between there is a huge garden area. The castle served as the Viennese summer residence for the successful general Prince Eugene of Savoy.The baroque castle garden was created between 1700 and 1721 according to the concept of the garden architect Dominique Girard, who worked at the Munich court and was once a student of André Le Nôtre.\n\nLe Nôtre designed the gardens of the Palace of Versailles for Louis XIV. The Belvedere palace garden is structured symmetrically along a central axis based on the French model and includes trees and hedges trimmed to shape, numerous sculptures and various water features. The historic orangery is still open to visitors today.\n\nStaged path systems with lines of sight lead to the heart of the complex, the Upper Belvedere. In front of the entrance to the castle, two concise sphinx figures stand guard. They embody power and strength paired with human insight. In addition to the baroque gardens, the Belvedere area is also home to one of the oldest alpine gardens in Europe. It covers an area of over 2,500 m² and is home to around 4,000 alpine plant species from all over the world.",
